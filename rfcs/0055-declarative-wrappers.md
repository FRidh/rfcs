# Declarative Wrappers
[summary]: #summary

Nixpkgs has many 

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected
outcome?

# Detailed design
[design]: #detailed-design

This is the core, normative part of the RFC. Explain the design in enough
detail for somebody familiar with the ecosystem to understand, and implement.
This should get into specifics and corner-cases. Yet, this section should also
be terse, avoiding redundancy even at the cost of clarity.

# Examples and Interactions
[examples-and-interactions]: #examples-and-interactions

This section illustrates the detailed design. This section should clarify all
confusion the reader has from the previous sections. It is especially important
to counterbalance the desired terseness of the detailed design; if you feel
your detailed design is rudely short, consider making this section longer
instead.

# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this?

# Alternatives
[alternatives]: #alternatives

What other designs have been considered? What is the impact of not doing this?

# Unresolved questions
[unresolved]: #unresolved-questions

What parts of the design are still TBD or unknowns?

# Future work
[future]: #future-work

What future work, if any, would be implied or impacted by this feature
without being directly part of the work?
